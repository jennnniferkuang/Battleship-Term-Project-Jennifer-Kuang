# Battleship Term Project Jennifer Kuang
## Description
Battleship is a 2 player game. For this app, the user is one player and the opponent is the computer. Each player starts out by placing 4 ships on their board, vertically or horizontally. When the game starts, the players take turns guessing a cell on the other's grid. If the guess lands on the opponent's ship, the ship takes a hit. Once all the cells containing a ship are hit, the ship is 'sunk'. The goal of the game is to guess all the cells containing the opponent's ships before the other player guesses yours.

## How to Set Up
All you need is the folder containing the Python code file and the assets folder. To run, open the folder containing both of these elements and run the Python code in VS Code. As long as the assets folder is open alongside the code, it should run perfectly fine.

## Libraries
I did not use any libraries appart from the CMU Graphics library and Pillow for images. All other libraries I used are built-in Python libraries.

## Images
All battleship assets are illustrated by my friend. His Instagram is @gawain_draws. All assets are paid for, with all rights to personal use given to me as the commissioner.
The hit image is the collision emoji from Apple.

## References
The only references I used were for images. These were taken from the Piazza post (https://piazza.com/class/li3k33dc9yl37f/post/424) or from the official Pillow module documentation (https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.rotate )

## Shortcuts
Press 'a' to automatically guess a random cell on the computer's grid. Will also speed up the computer player's guessing speed. This means you wait for less time before your turn comes around again.

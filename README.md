# Battleship Term Project Jennifer Kuang
 
***What's in this repo so far:***
- Asset folder containing:
    - 2 planes, 1 for each opposing side
    - 8 ships, 4 for each opposing side
- Python file containing all code so far (see 'code' section)
- This readme file
- A gitattributes file that has absolutely no use to me

**Assets:**
- All battleship/plane assets are illustrated by my friend. His Instagram is 
    @gawain_draws. All assets are paid for, with all rights to personal use 
    given to me as the commissioner. As of now these are the only assets I have.

**Code:**
- Ship class (need 8 total, likely need to relate to grids in a way)
- Grid class (need 2 for game)

**To Do:**
- How to change app.width/height to screen width/height or let user choose
- How to upload and use images

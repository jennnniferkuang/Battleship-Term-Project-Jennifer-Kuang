# Battleship Term Project Jennifer Kuang
 
***What's in this repo so far:***
- Asset folder containing:
    - 2 planes, 1 for each opposing side
    - 8 ships, 4 for each opposing side
    - hit ship image (Apple collision emoji)
- Python file containing all code so far (see 'code' section)
- This readme file
- A gitattributes file that has absolutely no use to me

**Assets:**
- All battleship/plane assets are illustrated by my friend. His Instagram is 
    @gawain_draws. All assets are paid for, with all rights to personal use 
    given to me as the commissioner. As of now these are the only assets I have.

**Code:**
- I lied there's too much code just read the actual code

**Reach MVP:**
- computer search in direction
- make ships stay in board bounds
- 

**Post MVP:**
- super mode (randomly spawned power-ups)
- better graphics
- add in search area and ability to choose area to search in

**Dev Only:**
